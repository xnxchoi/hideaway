# The Hideaway
  ## Introduction
  This is the official repository for The Hideaway, a platform with one foot in the online realm, and the other in the physical, intimate realm of society.
  ## Explanation
  A quick rundown: The Hideaway is in its very-early-state. Being a solo development project, compromise was a necessity in bringing this platform out to the world in a timely manner.
  Consequently, The Hideaway is currently a Wordpress-run, very-much-plugin-dependent website. This means that a majority of the site's identity comes from the particular combination of plugins, theme, and custom styling. Therefore it is no mistake that a majority of this repo will simply be a messy, bloat-filled pile of CSS files.
